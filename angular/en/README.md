## 1. What is Angular, and how does it differ from AngularJS?

**Angular** is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Angular is developed and maintained by Google and is often referred to as Angular 2+ or simply Angular to distinguish it from its predecessor, AngularJS.

**AngularJS**, on the other hand, is the original version of Angular, which is based on JavaScript and was released in 2010.

### Differences:

- **Language**: Angular uses TypeScript, while AngularJS uses JavaScript.
- **Architecture**: Angular has a component-based architecture, whereas AngularJS uses a scope and controller model. 
- **Performance**: Angular provides better performance with improved dependency injection and change detection mechanisms. 
- **Mobile Support**: Angular is designed with mobile support in mind, whereas AngularJS is not. 
- **Tooling**: Angular comes with advanced tooling and CLI for efficient development, whereas AngularJS has more basic tooling.

### Example:

- **Angular (TypeScript):**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>Hello, Angular!</h1>',
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

- **AngularJS (JavaScript):**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('myController', function($scope) {
    $scope.message = 'Hello, AngularJS!';
  });
```

## 2. Explain the architecture of an Angular application.

An Angular application is structured as a collection of modules, components, and services.

### Architecture:

- **Modules**: The fundamental building blocks. An Angular app typically has a root module and feature modules. 
- **Components**: Define views using HTML templates. Every component has a TypeScript class, HTML template, and styles. 
- **Templates**: Define the view and use directives and binding markup to connect the DOM with the component. 
- **Services**: Provide business logic and data access. They are typically injected into components. 
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Angular uses DI to provide components with the services they need.

### Example:
A simple Angular module with a component and a service:
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [DataService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## 3. What are Angular modules, and why are they important? Describe the role of NgModule in Angular.

Angular modules are a way to organize an application and manage dependencies. They help encapsulate components, directives, pipes, and services, making the code more modular and maintainable.

NgModule is a decorator that marks a class as an Angular module and provides metadata about the module.

### Importance:

- **Organization**: Modules group related components and services. 
- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different parts of an application or even different applications. 
- **Dependency Management**: Modules manage service instances and dependencies.

## 4. What is a component in Angular?

A component in Angular is a building block for the UI, consisting of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and optionally, styles.

### Example:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: '<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>',
  styles: ['h1 { color: blue; }']
})
export class HelloComponent {
  name: string = 'World';
}
```

## 5. How do you create a new component, service, pipe and directive in Angular? What other options are available for generating code in Angular?

In Angular, creating new components, services, pipes, and directives can be done using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). Below are the steps and commands for each:

**1. Creating a New Component:**

To create a new component, use the following command:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

or shorthand: 

```bash
ng g c component-name
```

This command will generate a new folder named `component-name` containing the component's **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **spec** files.

**2. Creating a New Service:**

To create a new service, use the following command:

```bash
ng generate service service-name
```

or shorthand: 

```bash
ng g s service-name
```

This command will generate a service-name.service.ts file with a basic service class and a spec file for testing.
