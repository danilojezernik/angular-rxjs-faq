## 30. How do you use the Renderer2 service in Angular?

### Angular Renderer2 Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `Renderer2` service in Angular to manipulate the DOM in a safe and
platform-agnostic way.

### Overview

The `Renderer2` service allows you to:

- Set and remove styles and classes.
- Set and remove attributes.
- Create, append, and remove elements.
- Listen to events on elements.

### Example Code

Here's a complete example showing how to use `Renderer2` to create and manipulate elements dynamically in an Angular
component.

### Component Code

Create a new Angular component and use the following code:

```typescript
import {Component, Renderer2, ElementRef, OnInit} from '@angular/core'

@Component({
    selector: 'app-dynamic-element',
    template: '<div class="container">Container</div>'
})
export class DynamicElementComponent implements OnInit {
    constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private el: ElementRef) {
    }

    ngOnInit() {
        this.createAndAppendElement()
    }

    createAndAppendElement() {
        const container = this.el.nativeElement.querySelector('.container')

        // Create a new div element
        const newDiv = this.renderer.createElement('div')

        // Set styles and attributes
        this.renderer.setStyle(newDiv, 'background-color', 'blue')
        this.renderer.setStyle(newDiv, 'color', 'white')
        this.renderer.setAttribute(newDiv, 'title', 'Dynamically Created Div')

        // Set inner text
        const text = this.renderer.createText('Hello, I am a dynamic div!')
        this.renderer.appendChild(newDiv, text)

        // Append to the container
        this.renderer.appendChild(container, newDiv)
    }
}
```

### Explanation

#### Importing Renderer2 and ElementRef:

```typescript
import {Component, Renderer2, ElementRef, OnInit} from '@angular/core'
```

#### Injecting Renderer2 and ElementRef:

```typescript
constructor(private
renderer: Renderer2, private
el: ElementRef
)
{
}
```

#### Creating and Manipulating Elements:

```typescript
createAndAppendElement()
{
    const container = this.el.nativeElement.querySelector('.container')
    const newDiv = this.renderer.createElement('div')
    this.renderer.setStyle(newDiv, 'background-color', 'blue')
    this.renderer.setStyle(newDiv, 'color', 'white')
    this.renderer.setAttribute(newDiv, 'title', 'Dynamically Created Div')
    const text = this.renderer.createText('Hello, I am a dynamic div!')
    this.renderer.appendChild(newDiv, text)
    this.renderer.appendChild(container, newDiv)
}
```

## 31. How do you use ElementRef in Angular and what is the difference between Renderer2 and ElementRef

`ElementRef` is a service in Angular that provides a direct reference to a native DOM element within your component or
directive. It is useful when you need to access or manipulate the DOM directly. However, direct DOM manipulation using
ElementRef should be done sparingly due to potential security risks and issues with Angular's change detection
mechanism.

### Basic Usage of `ElementRef`

To use `ElementRef`, you need to import it from @angular/core and inject it into your component or directive. Here’s a
simple example:

#### Example Component:

```typescript
import { Component, ElementRef, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div class="example">Example Component</div>'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.changeBackgroundColor()
  }

  changeBackgroundColor() {
    const div = this.el.nativeElement.querySelector('.example')
    div.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow'
  }
}
```

#### In this example:

1. **Inject ElementRef**: The `ElementRef` is injected into the component's constructor. 
2. **Access Native Element**: The `nativeElement` property of `ElementRef` is used to get a reference to the actual DOM element. 
3. **Manipulate DOM**: The background color of the `.example` div is changed directly.

### Difference Between Renderer2 and ElementRef

#### Purpose and Use Cases:
**ElementRef**:
- Direct DOM Access: Provides direct access to the native DOM element. 
- Use Cases: Simple or low-level DOM manipulations that are straightforward and won't pose security risks. 
- Example Use: Quickly changing styles, attributes, or properties of an element.

**Renderer2**:

- **Abstracted DOM Access**: Provides a way to interact with the DOM indirectly, ensuring compatibility with Angular's rendering engine and supporting various platforms (such as server-side rendering). 
- **Use Cases**: Safe and consistent DOM manipulations, event handling, and ensuring compatibility with Angular’s change detection and rendering mechanisms. 
- **Example Use**: Setting styles, classes, and attributes in a way that works across different environments.

### Safety and Compatibility:

**ElementRef**:

- **Direct Access**: Can introduce security risks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) if not handled properly.
- **Change Detection**: Direct DOM manipulation might bypass Angular's change detection, potentially causing inconsistencies.

**Renderer2**:

- **Encapsulated Access**: Ensures that all DOM manipulations are safe and adhere to Angular's security model.
- **Change Detection**: Works seamlessly with Angular’s change detection, ensuring that any changes to the DOM are properly tracked and updated.

### Example Comparison:

**Using ElementRef**:

```typescript
import { Component, ElementRef, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div class="example">Example Component</div>'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    const div = this.el.nativeElement.querySelector('.example')
    div.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow'
  }
}
```

**Using Renderer2**:

```typescript
import { Component, Renderer2, ElementRef, OnInit } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div class="example">Example Component</div>'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private el: ElementRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    const div = this.el.nativeElement.querySelector('.example')
    this.renderer.setStyle(div, 'background-color', 'yellow')
  }
}
```

### Summary

**ElementRef**:

- Provides direct access to native DOM elements. 
- Should be used sparingly due to potential security and change detection issues. 
- Suitable for simple, low-level DOM manipulations.

**Renderer2**:

- Provides a safe, abstracted way to manipulate the DOM. 
- Ensures compatibility with Angular’s rendering engine and change detection. 
- Preferred for most DOM manipulations to ensure safety and platform compatibility.

Using `Renderer2` is generally recommended for DOM manipulations in Angular applications because it ensures that your code remains safe, maintainable, and compatible with Angular's rendering mechanisms.

## 32. What is Angular Ivy? How does it improve the Angular framework?

### Angular Ivy

#### What is Angular Ivy?
