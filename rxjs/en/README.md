## 1. What is RxJS?
## 2. Explain the concept of Observables in RxJS.

**Observables** are a core concept in RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), which is a library for reactive programming using observables. Observables represent a sequence of events or values over time, allowing developers to handle asynchronous data streams efficiently.

### Key Concepts of Observables:
1. Producer: The source of data that generates values over time. This could be anything from user inputs, web service requests, or other asynchronous data streams. 
2. Consumer: The subscriber or observer that consumes the values emitted by the observable.

### Observable Life Cycle:
1. Creation: An observable is created using various creation methods provided by RxJS.
2. Subscription: Observers subscribe to the observable to start receiving data. 
3. Execution: The observable starts producing values and pushes them to subscribers. 
4. Completion/Error: The observable completes or errors out, terminating the data stream.

### Advantages of Observables:
- Asynchronous Handling: Manage asynchronous data streams effortlessly. 
- Composability: Use operators to combine multiple observables or transform data. 
- Lazy Execution: Observables do not execute until subscribed, making them efficient. 
- Cancellation: Subscriptions can be easily canceled, stopping the data flow.
