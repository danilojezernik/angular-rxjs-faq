# Angular and RxJs Interview Questions

This is for learning purposes only. The questions are based on the official Angular and RxJs documentation, and other sources. The answers are not guaranteed to be correct. It is something I'm doing as a personal project to learn and understand Angular and RxJs better. It is still under development, and I will probably be adding more questions and answers as I learn more about Angular and RxJs or combine or delete current ones.
